function a(){
    let b = 3;  // Declare a local variable 'b' and assign it the value 3.
    
    x();  // Call the function 'x' before it is defined, which works due to hoisting.
    
    function x() {  // Function declaration for 'x'. This function logs the value of 'b'.
        console.log(b);  // Log the value of 'b' to the console.
    }

    return x;  // Return the function 'x'.
}

a();  // Call the function 'a'. This will log 3 to the console because 'x' is called within 'a'.

let f = a();  // Call the function 'a' again. This will log 3 to the console and assign the returned function 'x' to the variable 'f'.

// The code you provided demonstrates several important JavaScript concepts: function scope, hoisting, and closures. Let's break down the concepts used:

// Function Declaration and Scope:
// The function a is defined. Inside this function, the variable b is declared and assigned the value 3.
// The function x is declared within a, which means x is local to a and cannot be accessed outside of it.

// Hoisting:
// In JavaScript, function declarations are hoisted to the top of their containing scope. This means that the entire function declaration for x is moved to the top of function a, making it available throughout a even before its actual line of declaration.
// As a result, the call x() inside a works correctly, even though x is defined after it in the code.

// Closure:
// When a is called, it creates a new execution context. Within this context, b is defined and x() is called, logging the value of b (which is 3) to the console.
// The function a then returns the function x. Because x is defined within a, it forms a closure. This means x retains access to the scope in which it was created, even after a has finished executing.

// Calling Functions and Returning Functions:

// The first call to a() executes x(), which logs 3 to the console.
// The second call to a() also executes x() (logging 3 again) and assigns the returned function x to the variable f.
// Assignment and Invocation:

// let f = a(); assigns the function x (returned by a) to f. This means f now holds a reference to the
