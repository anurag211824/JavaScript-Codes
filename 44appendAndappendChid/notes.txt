In JavaScript, both appendChild() and append() are methods used to add content to a DOM element, 
but they have key differences in their functionality and usage.

1.appendChild() Method:

Node Addition: Appends a single Node object (element or text node) as the last child of a parent node.
Return Value: Returns the appended child node.
Limitations: Only accepts one node at a time and does not support adding multiple nodes or strings directly.

const parent = document.getElementById('parent');
const child = document.createElement('div');
parent.appendChild(child);

In this example, a new <div> element (child) is created and appended to the element with the ID parent.


2.append() Method:

Content Addition: Allows appending multiple Node objects and DOMString (text) objects as children of a parent node.
Return Value: Does not return a value (undefined).
Flexibility: Supports adding multiple nodes and strings in a single call.

const parent = document.getElementById('parent');
const text = 'Hello, World!';
const child = document.createElement('div');
parent.append(text, child);




Key Differences:
Types of Content: appendChild() only accepts Node objects, while append() can handle both Node objects and strings.
Multiple Arguments: appendChild() appends a single node at a time; append() can append multiple nodes and strings simultaneously.
Return Value: appendChild() returns the appended node; append() returns undefined.
